// Package reviewloop is a worked machine: a Stop-loop that asks a formal oracle
// whether the user's task is complete and, until it is, refuses the stop and
// tells Claude to continue. It exercises every load-bearing feature — a lazily
// run formal-oracle cell, term-gated branching, Block-on-Stop as the "keep
// going" primitive, a fail-safe when output falls outside the language, and the
// fuel bound that guarantees the loop ends.
